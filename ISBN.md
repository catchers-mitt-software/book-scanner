#  The ISBN format

The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) format allows each book published 
anywhere in the world to be uniquely identified by a 10- or 13-digit number. 
These numbers consist of four or five elements, which are typically separated by 
dashes or spaces in the human-readable number printed on the book itself, but 
those separators are omitted from the barcode.

ISBNs are administered by the International ISBN Agency, which has affiliate 
agencies in several countries.

## ISBN-10

Although ISBN-10 is deprecated in favor of ISBN-13, the large number of books 
printed with the old numbers that are still in libraries everywhere prevents the 
complete abandonment of ISBN-10 numbers. The old ISBN-10 numbers can be 
converted to ISBN-13 numbers, as will be detailed later on in this document.

An ISBN-10 number consists of four elements:

* The registration group element, which consists of one to five digits and 
identifies the registration group the publisher is in. For example, the 
registration group element for many books in English printed in the United 
States are in registration group 0.
* The registrant element, which may consist of up to seven digits depending on 
how many digits are taken up by the registration group element, and identifies 
the publisher as registered for ISBN. For example, Riverhead Books, an imprint 
of Penguin Random House LLC which is in registration group 0, is registrant 
7352.
* The publication element, which may consist of up to six digits depending on 
how many digits are taken up by the previous two elements, identifies the book 
itself. *Kingdom of Characters* by Jing Tsu is publication 1473 for registrant 
Riverhead Books.
* The check digit is the final digit, it may be any of 0 to 10, that last one 
written as 'X' when it comes up. The check digit is calculated according to a 
mathematical formula on the previous nine digits. The check digit reassures us 
that a barcode has been scanned correctly, or that the number has been typed 
correctly when the barcode is not scannable.

## ISBN-13

The newer format was instituted well before publishers started running out of 
ISBN-10 numbers. It was devised in such a way that any book with an ISBN-10 
number automatically has an ISBN-13 number as well.

An ISBN-13 number consists of five elements:

* A prefix element of three digits decreed by the International ISBN Agency. At 
first, this was always 978, and that will always be the prefix when converting 
ISBN-10 numbers to ISBN-13. Many newer books have also been assigned prefix 978, 
which means that technically those books also have ISBN-10 numbers. A few years 
ago, the agency started assigning prefix 979. Those numbers are not backwards 
compatible to ISBN-10.
* The registration group element.
* The registrant element.
* The publication element.
* The check digit is the final digit, it may be any of 0 to 9. It is calculated 
according to a mathematical formula on the previous twelve digits. But it is 
a different formula from the one used for ISBN-10.
