# Book Scanner

WORK IN PROGRESS

The idea is that this app will scan ISBN barcodes and pull up book data. It will 
not scan UPCs.

I'm thinking of using the Open Library API.

For information about the ISBN format, I will be consulting 
[the ISBN.org FAQ](https://www.isbn.org/faqs_general_questions).
